description: 'My goal in this book is to provide a short but searching account of string theory for the layperson. I describe many of the central features of string theory and superstring theory, including tachyons, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, dualities, and branes. I devote two chapters at the end to the efforts to apply string theory to understand collider physics.'
